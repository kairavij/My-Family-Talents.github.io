<p>It was a beautiful summer day!
<font color="cyan"><b><strong>I was brought back to reality- from my slumber- by the mischievous sun’s rays, trying to play hide and seek with me through the tiny opening in the curtain in my room.</strong></b></font>
This happened even though <font color="cyan"><b><strong>the curtains had tried their best in guarding me from the disrupting arrows of the sun.</strong></b></font>
After getting refreshed, I advanced towards my balcony door.
I was dumbstruck by the picturesque view in front of me; my nosey neighbours, for a change, were <font color="lime"><u><marquee width="200" height="30" bgcolor="purple">basking underneath the energetic sun</marquee></u></font>to refurbish their vitamin D levels’.
This happening tempted me to join them and have <font color="lime"><u><marquee width="200" height="30" behavior="alternate">a bathe in the sunshine.</marquee></u></font>
After a good deal of time, I planned to go out to experience and enjoy more of these weird, yet interesting things!</p>
<p>As<img src="Super Drug.jpg" height="200" width="200" title="Crowd Outside Super Drugs on a Scorching Day." align="right">I strolled along the boisterous paths of Harrow, I was astounded to have a glimpse of shops, such as: Super Drugs and Boots, to be occupied by half of Harrow- on- the Hill to protect themselves from the powerful UV-rays of the ferocious sun. 
The serene wind blew past me,<font color="cyan"><b><strong> whispering me in my ear,</strong></b></font><font color="yellow"><i><em> as sluggishly as a turtle.</em></i></font>
I continued my tranquil walk; I was eager to explore more extraordinary happenings.
Soon, <font color="cyan"><b><strong>I was welcomed by amiable trees bowing to me from all around.</strong></b></font>
<font color="lime"><u><marquee width="200" height="30" vspace="10">The blanket of emerald green grass, with brown patches all over, resembling a pizza with toppings,</marquee></u></font><font color="yellow"><i><em>stretched as far as the eyes could see.</em></i></font>
All local parks and public areas were streaming with ecstatic children and <font color="yellow"><i><em>were as crowded as a football stadium on the day of Manchester United’s match.</em></i></font></p>
<p>On my way back, I could hear the <font color="cyan"><b><strong>rapid crying of miscellaneous, melancholic shops because of the fierce glares of the sun,</strong></b></font> as the sun had reached its peak and had turned into the scorching sun from the soothing sun, that all of the population loved.
Luckily,<font color="lime"><u><marquee width="200" height="30" hspace="30" bgcolor="red"> precipitation took over (making the sky dull), soon creating a psychedelic rainbow</marquee></u></font><font color="cyan"><b><strong>which gave shelter to the flamboyant shops crying sorrowfully.</strong></b></font>
Finally, at the end of my ‘trip’, I returned back home- having a wonderful day!</p>
