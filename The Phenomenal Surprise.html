<p>Dear Diary,</p>	
<p>I am flabbergasted!
Today <i><em><font color="green">my dad, who is as precious as a jewel</font></em></i> has finally brought <font color="purple"><marquee loop="1"><b><strong>my one and only dream to life</strong></b></marquee></font>; he (being a scientist) has at last found an evidence on the existence of aliens – a research all scientists have been working on for years.
I can’t believe it has been finished by my very own dad.
This has been my only ambition and has now come true!</p>
Since childhood itself, I have been fascinated by extraterrestrial creatures and have been wanting to prove the existence of aliens.
On this news,<u><font color=“blue”> my heart came in mouth</font></u>; I am just overwhelmed! <font color="purple"><marquee loop=“2”><b><strong>
The moment this news broke out, there was impenetrable silence contaminating amongst my mother, sister and me </strong></b></marquee></font> (not my scientist father of course, as he is the discoverer of this piece of information).</p>
<p>Although this has been my goal, <u><font color=“deepblack”> a creep of fear is also growing inside me</font></u>; can aliens be harmful?
Will they destroy mankind?
<u><font color=“deepblack”>Horror is sharing me, alongside curiosity.
</font></u> Perhaps, this idea is hazardous, this news is life-threatening.
<font color="purple"><marquee loop=“3”><b><strong> However, I have started fighting against my fear, </strong></b></marquee></font> since I found out the key of all this adrenaline rushes in my body.</p>
<p>My father has ultimately exposed the evidence after extreme imploring from me.
He told me that he had found some elements and equipment not yet invented on Earth.
This proved that there are other living creatures (which must be aliens) outside our beloved planet; life existed far beyond the atmosphere of Earth, far away into eternity.
I was and still am gobsmacked! I am just speechless!</p>
<p>Currently, my parents are working on publishing this news to all scientists worldwide via newspapers, the television, magazines and any other source they can.
I am super proud!</p>
