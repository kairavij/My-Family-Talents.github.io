<font size="5" color="pink" face="cursive"><p>Mrs Lindaâ€™s <font color="green"><b><strong>eyes were showing</strong></b></font> that her <font color="red"><u>life was as melancholic as a pretty flower in a bunch of merciless thorns</u></font>. Her sadness was crystal clear. <font color="green"<b><strong>Her eyes were cameras allowing her</b></strong></font> to flashback to her memories (miserable or gay). <font color="purple"><i><em>Tears were diving down her sorrowful eyes</i></em></font>, narrowing into the distance. Agony had pushed her hazel blue eyes into deep holes and dark circles have surrounded them as a dry moat surrounding a destroyed castle. <font color="purple"><i><em>Her eyes directed to a once beautiful girl now a flower</i></em></font>, which withered to grey in the ice cold rural areas of Canada. <font color="green"><b><strong>Her eyes were a power point presentation presenting the hardships of her past life</b></strong></font>; the former <font color="red"><u>were as swollen as a blister from a burn</u>.</font></p>
<p>All her recollections (distressing or jolly) kept on recurring in her mind because of the regular abuses of ageism. On the contrary, her <font color="red"><u>childhood was as bright and colourful as the festival of holi</u></font>. <font color="green"><b><strong>Her days were always her birthday</b></strong></font>, as they were so delightful. How fun it had been witnessing the 52 years of Christmas. However the time when her husband passed away (33 years ago) and she became a widow, was a catastrophe! All her hopes and dreams were <font color="red"><u>shattered like pieces of glass</u></font>; her depressing time full of hardships begun. From then on, she has been the victim of taunts and old age.</p>
<p>Her <font color="red"><u>face was as wrinkly as a dry leaf</u></font> floating down the rough bark of a tall tree in a cold autumn morning. <font color="green"><b><strong>The wrinkles were a map plotting and recording all the sufferings she had gone through</b></strong></font>. All the <font color="green"><b><strong>curls and curves of each wrinkle were fierce waves</b></strong></font> in the middle of a dark, azure ocean. The creases deepened on every distress she had to go through. <font color="green"><b><strong>They were hints</b></strong></font> on her dismal towards her hearty and florid old age.</p>
<p>Her hair no more cascaded down her distressingly ancient face like it used to in her juvenile. They <font color="red"><u>turned as white as snow</u></font> from the once bright blonde ones. They <font color="red"><u>were as lifeless as a graveyard</u></font> with the dead bodies of many innocent like her. <font color="green"><b><strong>She was a precious antique</b></strong></font> yet no one loved or cared for her. <font color="green"><b><strong>Her hair was a bundle of joy</b></strong></font> reminding her of her life when she was a youth. They were the symbol of her family members, who are now safe in the eternity of heaven.</p>
<p>She has been the main generation of her ancestors to have followed farming in Alberta for the last 72 years or so. Mrs Linda has served all farm animals from the bottom of her heart. She has been considered as jewel by the thankful animals in the farm owned by her family. Linda is the best farmer of Alberta yet has not been rewarded with love and care from the mean mankind. All her hard work and effort has been waste, when no one has considered on helping or looking after her in her shrunken and squalid old age.</p>
<p>She wore humble clothes- suitable for the weather and climate of Alberta, Canada. The impenetrable, <font color="green"><b><strong>furry coat was a shield protecting her heart from the hands of winter</b></strong></font>. The latter <font color="red"><u>was as hefty as molten lead</u></font>. Her clothes were her only source of heat and warmth. Her life was now all depended on the amount of warmth, shelter, food, water and all the basic needs she required and had.</p>
