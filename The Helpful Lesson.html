<font size="5" face="cursive"><p><font color="purple"><b><strong>The park was the world</strong></b></font> because it was just so populated with people (old and young) ecstatically playing, resting or basking in the<font color="lime"><u> powerful rays of the ferocious sun glaring at them,</u></font> to enrich their vitamin D levels; the lofty trees were <font color="orange"><i><em>dancing as gracefully as a ballerina in the gentle gust.</em></i></font>
<font color="purple"><b><strong>They were rockets</strong></b></font> shooting up into the sky.</p>
<p>Mary was devastated at the sudden incident; her heart was in her mouth, rapidly skipping beats.
There was a MASSIVE PROBLEM! <font color="purple"><b><strong>Her life –which was actually her friend Zara-</strong></b></font> had been smashed hard (on the head) with <font color="orange"><i><em>a ball as rigid as a diamond</em></i></font>.
Depression had conquered her mind for letting such a catastrophe take place.</p>
<p>“Ouch! It’s paining a lot Mary, please help me out!” exclaimed Zara excruciatingly, pressing her head to get the bleeding to a halt.</p>
<p><font color="lime"><u>Heaps and heaps of blood was oozing out and crawling down her chubby cheeks bidding adieu to her parched lips and then dripping down onto her clothes, descending to the rough, uneven floor of the picturesque park.</u></font>
She had to be immediately carried to the safe custody and hospitality of the kind and caring doctors and nurses.
But how are they going to do that? “Please hurry up Mary, it’s hurting a lot; I can’t bear it anymore,” murmured Zara in lots of pain and trouble.</p>
<p>“I am doing all I can, Zara!” replied Mary in a comforting voice “shall I use the ointments that you always carry in your handbag, as you say, to lessen the pain a bit, while you are taken to care?”</p>
<p>“No, no! Please don’t, just rush me to the emergency care centre <font color="orange"><i><em>as soon as possible,</em></i></font>” replied Zara in a panicking voice in case she got caught red-handed.</p>
<p><font color="purple"><b><strong>A fog of curiosity and confusion surrounded Mary</strong></b></font>. Her mind kept on wondering: why did Zara disagree with her idea; she was sure that Zara knew she would not go wrong because she was trained by her mother, who was a doctor.
<font color="purple"><b><strong>Her mother was a dictionary</strong></b></font>, as she had a lot of knowledge, however, she only taught her daughter, <font color="purple"><b><strong>who was a jewel to her</strong></b></font>, extraordinarily little.
She got curious because she wanted to know what was going on in Zara’s mind and why she did not permit Mary to use the medicines in such crucial time of need.</p>
<p><font color="lime"><u>Soon Mary was drifted back to originality</u></font>: <font color="orange"><i><em>to help poor Zara recover, as rapidly as arrows descending onto the harsh floor because of gravity,</em></i></font> Mary had made up her mind to do all she could.
<font color="purple"><b><strong>She was a devoted mother</strong></b></font> as she was dedicated to help her BFF.
To bring this idea into existence, she decided to request for help from other visitors at this enormous park currently, to handle the situation.</p>
<p>They implored to miscellaneous people narrating the depressing happening again and again, however, <font color="purple"><b><strong>they all were merciless thorns, poking a lovely flower,</strong></b></font> which was Zara, as none of those people (full of ego) had paid attention.
Then finally, Mary herself decided to carry her to help, using all her effort and might.</p>
<p>Struggling to maintain her vision of the road, Mary had finally arrived at their destination, with the wounded Zara, cosy in her arms, finally sleeping in her deep slumber after the panicking accident.
In the blink of an eye, Mary was in front of the counter questioning them if she could book a personal doctor and a couple of nurses to aid the doctor in helping her BFF (Best Friend Forever) <font color="orange"><i><em>recover as soon as possible.</em></i></font></p>
<p><font color="orange"><i><em>The handbag as hefty as molten lead,</em></i></font> that Zara had been carrying and had her medicines in, was right next to her; she had carried it all the way to the care centre in her arms, hanging by her side.
It was a bright pink colour with numerous sparks of golden all over it. <font color="purple"><b><strong>It was a miniscule castle</strong></b></font> because its appearance was identical to it.</p>
<p>Their private doctor was Dr Devi Gupta; she had 3 assistant nurses to aid her in curing Zara. Dr Devi, alongside her personal team, were experts in neurologist.
They were there right on time, trying to the best of their ability to cure her.
After a few hours of work, Dr Gupta announced: “Auspiciously, there is not much harm caused to your friend Mara and she will be fine in a couple of days here!”
“Thank you for the good news doctor, but I just wanted to correct you that her name is Zara, not Mara,” replied Mary.</p>
<p>Soon the room was empty, with only the unconscious Zara and her rescuer (Mary).
The inquisitiveness in Mary once again arouse, <font color="lime"><u>compelling her brain</u></font> to do something she never dared to: she was going to have a peek inside the aesthetic bag still hanging off Zara’s arm, <font color="orange"><i><em>which she was holding to herself as dear as life.</em></i></font></p>
Mary had always been a girl listening to her mind not heart, so yet again <font color="purple"><b><strong>Mary got persuaded to open the mystery box, with the key of her mind, ignoring her heart.</strong></b></font></p>
<p><font color="purple"><b><strong>Gathering courage,</strong></b></font> Mary headed towards her life’s bag, picking it up.
Although Zara had been carrying it the whole time, <font color="lime"><u>not even a single droplet of blood had danced its way down into the warmth of the purse.</u></font>
However, the moment Mary glanced inside it, <font color="purple"><b><strong>her life left her side and headed for eternity</strong></b></font>; she was flabbergasted at the sight in front of her.
<font color="lime"><u>She assumed her eyes had deceived her,</u></font> so she rubbed them properly and peeped inside again, but that was that!
Inside, there was jewellery, accessories, and gold, which was all of Zara’s stolen items; Mary exclaimed in distress to herself “Zara has been lying to me AND stealing! Why would she do that?”
<font color="purple"><b><strong>She sank into the nearby chair</strong></b></font> like a ship sinking into the deep, azure water of a sea.</p>
<p><font color="lime"><u>Her mind and heart paired up drifting her thoughts back to their childhood,</u></font> the days when <font color="orange"><i><em>they played like two bodies, but one heart and brain;</em></i></font></p><font color="orange"><i><em>if apart from each other they would feel like they were amputated.</em></i></font></p>
<font color="lime"><u>Mary has always had ginger hair cascading behind her dancing in the breezes. Her lengthy hair often collided against her fragile skin on her strong and tough body.</u></font>
<font color="purple"><b><strong>She had a bucket full of kindness</strong></b></font> resulting her respectful, generous, and responsible personality.
She had always been cautious, supportive, leader-like, helpful, and thoughtful, unlike Zara, who from childhood itself has been over joyous for everything and always careless over many matters.
<font color="lime"><u>Zara’s hair was blackish brown standing out in the powerful rays of the merciless sun glaring ferociously at them.</u></font></p>
<p>They both were quite good at tennis, badminton, karate, and painting, usually having competitions against each other.
<font color="purple"><b><strong>They two were magnets</strong></b></font>, <font color="lime"><u>never tearing apart</u></font> or having altercations in their friendship.
Just like they were good at the same hobbies, they did not pursue the same talents as well: singing, dancing, and cooking.
<font color="purple"><b><strong>Mary was a Prime Minister (PM)</strong></b></font> because she always persevering just like a PM.
However, <font color="purple"><b><strong>Zara was a retired sportsperson</strong></b></font> because she was not as resilient as Mary, yet they made phenomenal pairs.</p>
<p>Both of them were adhesive to each other; every single day they played at the <font color="orange"><i><em>park meandering like a serpent into the extensive main road leading to the vicinity of our abode.</em></i></font></p>
Their birthday parties have been as unique and special each year as compared to all the billions of humans in the whole wide world.
These two had been extremely sensible that their dear parents relied blindly on them and let them play in the park or study in their sweet homes together.
Their <font color="purple"><b><strong>relation had built strength every time they supported each other</strong></b></font>, erasing the need of other friends to encourage them.</p>
<p>It took quite a while before Mary recovered from her shock.
But when she did, she searched for her smartphone and narrated all the incidents that took place that day, <font color="orange"><i><em>as peculiar as going through a maze</em></i></font></p>, to Zara’s mother and father- <font color="purple"><b><strong>who were a swan for their graceful and polite attitude</strong></b></font> all the time.
Without wondering or taking any time,<font color="orange"><i><em> as swift as a racing car trying to win the race and get their heart back (which was actually the winner’s trophy),</em></i></font></p> they made their way to the hospitable hospital to solve the matter in their detective way, inquiring many questions.
Arriving at their destination, they sprinted to the cabin in which Zara was residing.</p>
<p>The cabin was booked by teenager Mary.
It was not too miniature, neither too enormous; <font color="orange"><i><em>it was as white and shiny as our teeth.</em></i></font></p>
It had flower vases made of translucent material, some flowers coloured with bright colours and the others with deep coloured flowers.
There were miscellaneous medicines on the side table, next to the ill Zara.</p>
<p>“Thank you sooooooo much, Mary, for all that you have done for our daughter,” thanked Mr John.</p>
<p>“We really appreciate it! We were extremely worried for our daughter, along with the anger and frustration creeping up us on our daughter behaving like this,” added Mrs John.</p>
<p>“Pleasure, but it really was not required to thank me, Mr John. It is my duty to protect your daughter, who is my friend,” answered back Mary.</p>
<p>“Thank you Mrs John! You don’t need to worry, I have taken perfect care of her. The anger is also rising in me, but let us first get to know why she has chosen to do so,” continued Mary in a soft and gentle voice.</p>
<p>Leading Mr and Mrs John to Zara’s spot, Mary called her parents and invited them to the hospital as well.
In the jiffy of a second, Mr and Mrs Darling had approached their love.
They all together stood (side-by-side) waiting for sick Zara to wake up, so they can inquire her on all the weird happenings that took place that unusual day.</p>
<p>The next thing that caught Zara’s eyes was when she came back to consciousness, she glimpsed her entire family (with her younger brother, Lucas) and Mary’s family surrounding her.
She could work out that they were feeling melancholic and furious, just by looking at their faces.
This perplexed her compelling her to question “What is the matter, why are you all looking so devastated?”</p>
<p>“Hope you are feeling better?” they all replied together.</p>
<p>“And yes we have learnt that you have been stealing!” continued Zara’s mum’s warm voice.</p>
<p>“Yes! Mary informed us that she had found stolen goods in your purse instead of medicines, like you always claimed.” Added Mr John not in his usual speaking tone.</p>
<p>Zara was gobsmacked!
What was she going to do? Escape.
She thought to herself.
Her mind argued against it, imploring to her to tell them the secret they were awaiting an answer for.
<font color="orange"><i><em>This situation was as puzzling as a murder mystery.</em></i></font></p>
<font color="purple"><b><strong>Picking confidence and strength</strong></b></font>, she sat upright glancing straight ahead.
Out of the blue, she <font color="purple"><b><strong>blurted out the clue to the locked box, permitting them to decipher the key from the well organised hint.</strong></b></font></p>
<p>She assented with them “Yes I did steal, I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>“But what was the reason you did this?” interrupted Mary.</p>
<p>Zara continued, taking a deep breath, “I didn’t mean to do any of this, it’s all cause of my parents. I really am regretful, but I just can’t help it, it really isn’t my fault! All I wanted to do was to punish them for their unnecessary and careless deeds.”</p>
<p>“What did we do wrong?” Her parents looked baffled.</p>
<p>“How can you not know when you actually did it? Well, you guys have always been fighting over miscellaneous miniature matters. You never halt arguing and making chaos in the entire house,” said Zara feeling as free as a bird flying frantically around to express her feelings now.</p>
<p>“It was Max’s fault!” exclaimed her mum.</p>
<p>“No! It was actually you!” replied her dad.</p>
<p>Zara frustrated from them for resuming the reason for her bad trait “Please stop, you’ve started it yet again! Also, you hardly spend time with me or Lucas and seldom pay attention to what we are doing. Do you even know what we study?”</p>
<p>“Umm, we are extremely sorry my darling. We really did not want that to come to this situation, sorry once again!” muttered Mr and Mrs John regretfully.</p>
<p>“And,” Zara continued on with her story “sadly enough, when I attempted to punish you, it turned into a habit, and I started liking it. And now here I am stealing like a robber. Only if you both could stop this behaviour of yours and take a little more interest in our lives, my habit might come to a halt, but it all depends on you, only you!”</p>
<p>“We promise, and we mean it, that we will never debate again, paying full attention to you and dear Lucas too.” Chorused Mr and Mrs John.</p>
<p>Zara replied “Thank you, I will try my hardest to be my old self again.”</p>
<p>“And I will help and support her too!” jumped in Mary.</p>
<p>Giving each other a warm hug, Zara and Mary felt content: Zara, because she let go of all her pain and insecurities; Mary, because her friend was relieved of the unnecessary burden that she had been carrying all along.
For the first time since marriage, Zara’s parents gave each other a loving embrace with salty water dripping down their cheeks.
They actually felt a sense of guilt that their irresponsible behaviour had led their darling daughter to such a state of confusion.
Anyways, now everything was sorted.</p>
So, all is well, that ends well.
